# Password
This section of the program implements a password authentication system. Users are prompted to enter a password, and their input is hidden with asterisks as they type. If the entered password matches the predefined correct password ("securekey123"), access is granted. Otherwise, users are given a limited number of attempts to enter the correct password before being denied access.

# Palindrome
This section of the program allows users to input a word and determines whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. The program checks if the input word remains the same when its characters are reversed. If it does, the word is classified as a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

# Anagram
This section of the program enables users to input two strings and determines whether they are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. The program removes spaces and punctuation from the input strings, sorts the characters alphabetically, and compares the sorted strings. If the sorted strings are identical, the input strings are considered anagrams; otherwise, they are not.

## C++
This program is a versatile command-line utility designed to perform various string manipulation tasks, including password authentication, palindrome checking, and anagram detection. Users interact with the program through a menu-driven interface, where they can choose between different functionalities:
